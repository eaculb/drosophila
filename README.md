# Drosophila Lab: An interactive genetics lab

The live app lives at https://drosophila-lab.eaculb.co/

## The story

My partner's mom is an AP bio teacher who relies heavily on a fantastic app, [FlyLab JS](https://www.sciencecourseware.org/FlyLabJS/). For a while, this site was down, but she desperately needed it for use in her lessons. I had recently started working with React and offered to build a replacement, both for her and as an opportunity to stretch my new React skills!

## Running locally

Simply clone this repository, then in the root folder, run

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Note: This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
